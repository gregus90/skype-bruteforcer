With this program you can bruteforce Skype accounts. This is probably the first public Skype bruteforce tool.
The developers of Skype are very fast in patching bugs and now there is a one minute anti-bruteforce protection.
The only solution is sleep(60) and that is the way that allowto bruteforce a Skype Account, but is very very
slow method. This tool is  for education purpose only, Use it at you'r own risk.
